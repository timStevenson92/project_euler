This repo is my collection of solutions to Project Euler problems
http://projecteuler.net/problems

The solutions are written in python and all by me. 
This is my way of teaching myself python and solving problems with logic, math, and code.
I'm hoping to improve my skills in these areas and more. I wrote the code in Notepad++ on Windows.
The best way to compile and view the answer is to download the .py file, 'cd' to the directory where it is located and run that
script in the commmand prompt.

If you would like to know more or have any constructive criticism, please feel free to 
contact me via email on my GitHub. Thank you!
