This repo is my collection of solutions to Project Euler problems
http://projecteuler.net/problems

The solutions are written in python and all by me. 
This is my way of teaching myself python and solving problems with logic, math, and code.
I'm hoping to improve my skills in these areas and more. I am hoping to update with at least
one project a week, maybe more.

If you would like to know more or have any constructive criticism, please feel free to 
contact me via email on my GitHub. Thank you!
